How to run the code:
1. Make sure you have the following in same directory as the notebook:
	a. night_images  #(with the images in this directory)
	b. config_secret.json #(Google API key stored as JSON)
2. Have OpenCV installed. Use `brew install homebrew/science/opencv` (on a Mac) to do so. Otherwise, visit http://opencv.org.
